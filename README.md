# EtherCAT_HAL
EtherCAT HAL component

This is an attempt to write an EtherCAT HAL component following
http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Etherlab , but
adopted for Xenomai and RT-Preemt.  

Some ideas were taken from
http://www.iram.fr/~blanchet/ethercat/akd/  
https://github.com/koppi/mk/blob/daa3fd64a0b2b61933cdda100c8679dcee8232cb/Machinekit-Xenomai-Thinkpad-X200.md

Build on Debian Wheeezy.
